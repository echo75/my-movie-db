# My Movie DB

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A MEVN stack application to help anyone manage their own little virtual movie library online.

## Accessing the app online

A hosted production version is temporarily unavailable. Please clone the project and follow the instructions to run it locally.

## Setting up locally for development

> **Note:**
> The guide assumes you have Docker and Docker Compose installed locally. If not, refer to the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for installation instructions.

You will need an API key for the following services:

- [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) for searching for movies

Create `.env` files in the frontend and backend directories with contents similar to the `.env.example` files.

Then, run the app with the following:

```bash
docker compose up -d mongo
docker compose up api frontend
```

This will start up the necessary Docker containers - the backend Node.js app, the MongoDB database, and the frontend Vue.js app. The Mongo container will be started in the background, so you don't get the tons of output from it.

The backend API will be available at http://localhost:3000 and the frontend at http://localhost:5173.

> **Note**: in dev environment, the app uses live reload for changes inside the `src` directory in both the frontend and backend. Any changes to files outside of `src`, e.g. package installations, will require a rebuild of the respective containers.

### Customising the environment

If using your own MongoDB instance, there is no need to run the mongo service, so after modifying `backend/.env` accordingly you can just run the app with:

```bash
docker compose up api frontend
```
